# restaurant-data-web-interface
The user can enter a postcode for 10 restaurants in that area, or view the default restaurant data from postcode 'EC4M7RF'. The restaurant data is generated by filtering and extracting data from the response from the third-party API. 

## How to build, compile and run the solution
1. Get Live Server extension for VSC
2. Clone the repository
3. Open the proxy-server-for-web-interface repository (which is a sub repository of restaurant-data-web-interface) in an IDE which supports Java
4. Run the executable file (ProxySErverForWebInterfaceApplication.java) from the IDE (this starts the embedded Tomcat server)
5. In VSC open the restaurant-data-web-interface.html file with Live Server
      - Open the repository in VSC
      - Right-hand click on restaurant-data-web-interface.html (file is inside the client folder) in the explorer tab. 
      - Select 'Open with Live Server' option

## Assumptions / things that were not clear to me
While I could retrieve the response object from the API using Postman without issues, I encountered a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) error when attempting to fetch data using the JavaScript fetch API in the client-side application. To solve this error, I created a proxy server using Java and Spring Boot. This proxy server acts as an intermediary between the client-side application and the third-party API. I used the @CrossOrigin annotation in the backend application for the web interface, as the third-party API resides on a different domain. By routing requests to the backend server, which initiates requests to the third-party API and returns the response to the client side, I effectively bypassed CORS restriction. 

Filtering the response in the backend meant less unnecessary data was passed to the client. Given the large response body, this optimisation meant the restaurant data on the web interface loads better. 

In my previous projects, I've developed web interfaces alongside their respective applications. However, I found it challenging to create a web interface in isolation without the context of the application it serves. The CORS issue prompted me to develop an application to complement the web interface. 

## Improvement / future edits
- Using TypeScript instead of JavaScript to enforce types on the client-side code. 
- Create a WAR file and deploy my application. 
- Include unit test with JUnit5 to have a more robust application
- Make @CrossOrigin annotation more restrictive - allows only ports running from the users local machine (i.e. domain names localhost or 127.0.0.1)
- More user feedback:
    - during the request-response cycle, while the form submission is being processed, a loading screen could be displayed to indicate that the application is awaiting the response
    - restrict user form entries only to characters contained in postcodes
    - add what countries postcodes are accepted from
 
## Comments
I've commented the code extensively in some places, especially concerning JSON parsing on the backend. This is to help me in future as it will be a handy reference given that it is my first time working with JSON in the backend.
